# Airbnb Data Analysis with SQL (2022)
Welcome to the Airbnb Data Analysis repository! In this project, we explore and analyze Airbnb data using SQL queries. This analysis provides valuable insights into the Airbnb market, allowing us to understand pricing trends, popular neighborhoods, host activity, and more.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains information about Airbnb listings in Menorca. It includes the following columns:
- **host_id:** The ID of the host
- **neighbourhood:** The neighborhood where the property is located
- **room_type:** The type of room (e.g., entire home/apartment, private room, shared room)
- **price:** The price per night for the listing
- **minimum_nights:** The minimum number of nights required for booking
- **number_of_reviews:** The total number of reviews for the listing
- **calculated_host_listings_count:** The number of listings the host has
- **availability_365:** The number of days the listing is available in a year
- **number_of_reviews_ltm:** The number of reviews in the last twelve months
